# 🧠 Plastic Detection & Classification using Deep Learning

An AI-powered plastic waste classification system that leverages deep learning and image processing to categorize waste into PET, PP, HDPE, and LDPE classes—enabling smarter recycling solutions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to automate the sorting of plastic waste by applying **deep learning neural networks** and **computer vision techniques**. Designed for use in recycling plants or smart bins, the system classifies plastic types in real-time using a trained convolutional model.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Plastic waste disposal is a pressing environmental issue, yet differentiating between types of plastics during recycling remains complex and inefficient. Manual sorting is:
- Labor-intensive
- Costly
- Prone to human error

This system proposes an automated method to identify recyclable plastic categories to enhance sustainability and recycling efficiency.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The model:
- Uses **YOLOv5** for object detection.
- Employs **VGG-16** for plastic type classification.
- Supports **real-time inference** from camera or uploaded images.

Accessible via local setup or mobile devices, the platform is suitable for small-scale household use or large-scale waste processing plants.

## ✅ Benefits

- 🔄 Automates plastic waste classification
- 🌱 Supports sustainable recycling operations
- 💸 Reduces manual labor and processing costs
- 📈 Improves the accuracy and speed of sorting
